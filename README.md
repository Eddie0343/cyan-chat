**Cyan Chat** (A fork of JChat) is an overlay that allows you to show your Twitch chat on screen with OBS, XSplit, and any other streaming software that supports browser sources. It supports your [**BetterTTV**](https://betterttv.com/), [**FrankerFaceZ**](https://www.frankerfacez.com/) and [**7TV**](https://7tv.app/) emotes, always at the best available quality. You have many options to customize your chat, like enabling a smooth animation for new messages, or fading old ones after some time. If you have a chat full of !gamble addicts, you can choose to hide bots and commands messages. It also comes with many fonts and styling options that can be combined as desired.
